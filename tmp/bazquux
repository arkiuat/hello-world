This file has the purpose of being a different file. It is also
going to be modified, but the reason it exists is because it's
different and I needed a different one. 

But the paragraph is so short now. And adding this does nothing to
fix that because this is obviously a completely different paragraph,
not a continuation of its predecessor.

Policy is to commit immediately after successfully testing a completed revision.
Revise the code, test until it passes, immediately commit.

Committing some changes that can't currently pass tests is like when I used to manually
make files with FORKED- prefixed to the filename.  Meaning that sometimes you have to do it.
And with modern revision control technology, I probably won't regret it as hard as I did when 
using manual revision control.
