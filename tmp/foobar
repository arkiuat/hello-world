This file exists only to be modified.

That is its purpose.

So now I have to modify it. I've got to add this line.

I guess if I want different commit message for each individual file,
I have to do the local commits one file at a time. But that makes
sense. I can do a bunch of commits to my local git repo without
pushing them, and then push all those commits at once. I guess
that's okay.
