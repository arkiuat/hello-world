# hello-world
This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow.

I've been working on producing some JSON files to automate the expansion of some ancient elisions, traditionally left unexpanded, in particular translations of some ancient texts maintained by another project on github. Eventually I'll want to make my work available to others, so this is me learning how to set up and use a github repository, that's all! I'll make a separate repository for the elision-expansion project once I'm ready to go public with it.

Also, once I start making other public repositories, I'll probably take this one private. Or not, I don't know much yet.
